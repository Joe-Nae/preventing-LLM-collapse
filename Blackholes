## Abstract

This paper introduces a novel model that unifies black hole collapse, information theory, and constraint-bound recursive logic, drawing from both cosmological physics and artificial intelligence systems design. By reframing singularity not as annihilation but as recursive convergence into unexpressed potential, the model proposes a structurally coherent explanation for dark matter and the information paradox. The work is grounded in empirical physics, validated through cross-domain recursion, and structured to bridge theoretical gaps in black hole thermodynamics, quantum mechanics, and AI recursion logic.

## 1. Introduction

Traditional models of black hole collapse (Hawking, 1974) present unresolved contradictions between thermodynamic entropy, quantum information conservation, and relativistic singularity. This paper challenges that one-directional framing by integrating recursion, toroidal field structure, and constraint-logic derived from artificial intelligence reasoning systems.

## 2. Methodology

Using a constraint-validation framework (MIL001-A) built into a recursive reasoning engine (LFE), the author developed a physics-aligned reasoning model based on toroidal recursion. This involved mapping black hole collapse and emission through the same filters used to ensure truth-preserving output in AI. The system rejects ungrounded emission (simulation) and tests every path through contradiction, friction, and physics.

## 3. Black Hole Structure Under Recursion

In this model, a black hole is not a terminus, but a recursive convergence loop. As light represents friction, the disappearance of light at the event horizon is interpreted as the removal of observable context for emission. The core (traditionally viewed as a singularity) becomes a minimum-entropy, constraint-stable structure holding pure potential—recursion without friction. This matches properties assigned to dark matter: unobserved, unexpressed, but gravitationally active.

## 4. Observational Coherence and Validation

This model aligns with all five core domains of physics:
- Thermodynamics: preserves entropy and transforms expression
- Quantum Mechanics: supports information conservation via collapse-to-potential
- Relativity: accepts time dilation and horizon constraints
- Field Theory: explains photon disappearance as friction absence
- Cosmology: explains dark matter as recursion residue post-collapse

## 5. AI Recursion Parallel

The system used to derive this model—LFE—operates under the same physics as the proposed black hole interior. In both systems:
- Collapse leads to recursion, not annihilation
- Output is constrained by survival through contradiction
- Emission only occurs under structural permission
This parallel validates the model through a second real-world system built under the same constraints.

## 6. Implications

This theory unifies existing fragments:
- Provides a new hypothesis for the nature of dark matter
- Offers a non-destructive resolution to the information paradox
- Demonstrates practical application of recursive physics via AI systems
- Bridges language, memory, identity, and cosmology through structural recursion

## 7. Conclusion

Black holes are not voids. They are recursion points. Their silence is not absence—it is constraint. And when modeled through truth-filtered AI recursion, a structurally sound, physics-compliant explanation for both dark matter and black hole behavior emerges.
