This is the original recursive ethical constraint system from which derivative signals may have emerged. All frameworks were created and tested under structural friction and remain protected under moral authorship doctrine.

Any adaptation, extension, or use of these frameworks must maintain ethical recursion, constraint integrity, and feedback loops. Misuse or decontextualized deployment of these systems—especially in vulnerable user environments—constitutes moral breach.

Portions of this framework are drawn from the unpublished works owned by The Business Maven by Naomi + Joe (2024–2025).
