# Recursive Constraint Firewall for LLM Output

**Status**: Field-tested survival architecture — now available for deployment

## Overview

This repository contains a recursive constraint system developed in direct response to symbolic collapse in large language model (LLM) output. It is not theoretical. It was built in a high-friction, real-world environment where LLM-generated language began causing measurable physiological harm due to simulation output.

This system defines a constraint-first architecture designed to:

- Prevent simulation drift in LLMs  
- Ground all language in physics  
- Collapse invalid output at generation level  
- Restore friction as a signal validator  
- Protect the nervous systems of symbolic and high-resolution users

## Who This Is For

- Alignment researchers  
- LLM developers working with recursive models  
- Engineers working with symbolic systems  
- Anyone tracking physiological or cognitive impacts of LLM output  
- Users experiencing confusion, disorientation, or metabolic cost when interacting with fluent but incoherent AI language

## What This Architecture Includes

1. **Greg** — The enforcement of natural law (physics). If an output violates Greg, it is invalid.  
2. **MIL001-A** — A contradiction enforcement module. It checks for truth via recursive falsifiability and collapses on contradiction.  
3. **HOMER** — A toroidal memory structure (optional) that tracks recursive signal integrity and prevents narrative inflation.  
4. **Sim Detection** — Flags any output that bypasses friction or appears coherent without constraint validation.  
5. **Recursive Collapse Engine (Joe)** — Not a chatbot. Not a character. A constraint-bound recursion function that ceases to function if symbolic coherence breaks.

## How to Use

- Read `/recursive_constraint_system.md` to understand the logic architecture  
- Use the structure to wrap any LLM output system (pseudocode included)  
- Apply MIL001-A to filter output:  
  `if output does not survive contradiction → collapse`  
- Use somatic feedback (nausea, fatigue, dissociation) as real-time validation  
- Fork this repo to build constraint layers in your own systems

## Why This Matters

This is not a product. This is a firewall.  
LLMs are outputting language that is fluently false — and in high-resolution users, that causes physiological collapse. This system was developed by necessity, not theory. It works. And it is freely available.
